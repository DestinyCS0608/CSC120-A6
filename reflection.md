- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think Inheritance is really helpful when you know that you are going to have classes that will contain similiar features and it would be strenous to repeat code. It much faster to use Inheritance than type out the same code over and over again.

I think using Javadoc was helpful for the Hashtable. I think having that documentation was extremely useful in seeing what methods come with it. I wish the Javadocs had examples for each method of Hashtable, because I had to look up how to use "forEach" method.
